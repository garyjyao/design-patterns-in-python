# design-patterns-in-python

A collection of design patterns implemented in Python.

## Creational Patterns

| Name                                                        | Description                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Prototype](./design_patterns/creational/prototype_pattern) | Duplicate(Clone) existing object so it's fast and exactly the same. |
| [Singleton](./design_patterns/creational/singleton_pattern) | Simple access point to a global a class that has only one instance. |

## Structural Patterns

## Behavioral Patterns

| Name                                                                  | Description                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Adapter_Class](./design_patterns/structural/adapter_class_pattern)   | Wraps an existing class with a new interface using inheritance so that it becomes compatible with the client's interface |
| [Adapter_Object](./design_patterns/structural/adapter_object_pattern) | Wraps an existing class with a new interface using composite so that it becomes compatible with the client's interface   |
| [Bridge](./design_patterns/structural/bridge_pattern)                 | Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, with composition to evolve two dimension independently                 |
| [Composite](./design_patterns/structural/composite_pattern)           | Compose objects into tree structure and treat uniformly (such as using recursion).                                       |
| [Decorator](./design_patterns/structural/decorator_pattern)           | Add behavior to object without affecting it's existing usage elsewhere.                                                  |
| [Facade](./design_patterns/structural/facade_pattern)                 | Hiding the complexity of the subsystems and providing a simple interface.                                                |
| [FlyWeight](./design_patterns/structural/flyweight_pattern)           | Minimize memory usage when dealing with a large number of objects.                                                       |
| [Proxy](./design_patterns/structural/proxy_pattern)                   | Proxy to another object and control access to it.                                                                        |
